## Description
this package is a renew version of [Giphy_Picker](https://pub.dev/packages/giphy_picker).
The idea of this package is to create different UI solutions so that each developer can adapt it to their project or customize it to their liking using two main classes that are
`giphy_grid_view.dart` and `giphy_searchview.dart`
